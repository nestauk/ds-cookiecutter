        - **Configure**

            Fetch (or generate) [security credentials from the AWS dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) by clicking "Create access key".

            Run `aws configure`, inputting the access key ID and secret access key ID you just generated when prompted.

            In addition you should set the default region name to `eu-west-2` and the default output format to `None`.

            AWS provide a more detailed guide [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config).
    - [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) - Automatically loads environment variables and environments
        ```bash
        brew install direnv  # Mac
        apt-get install -y direnv  # Ubuntu Linux
        ```
        Add `eval "$(direnv hook $SHELL)"` at the end of your `~/.${SHELL}rc` file.

### Create

Ensure you have installed the [requirements](#requirements) and then run `cookiecutter https://github.com/nestauk/ds-cookiecutter -c <VERSION TAG>`.

??? attention "If you do not specify a version tag then `cookiecutter` will use the latest commit on the `master` branch. Unless specifying a version you have used before, check the [release notes](https://github.com/nestauk/ds-cookiecutter/releases) to see what changed since you last created a project!"

    Currently, only the latest release's docs are available online.
    You can serve docs for a specific release on your machine by checking out that release and running `pip install -r requirements.txt && cd docs && mkdocs serve` and then navigating to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

This opens a series of prompts to configure your new project (values in square brackets denote defaults).

??? info "What do the prompts mean?"

    -   `project_name`: Type the name of your project here
    -   `repo_name`: Type the name of your repository here
        -   The default is a processed version of `project_name` that is compatible with python package names
    -   `author_name`: The author of the project
    -   `description`: A short description of your project
    -   `openness`: Whether the project is "public" (default) or "private"
        -   You should only make a project private if you have a good reason
        -   If "public" then an MIT license will be generated; otherwise the license will be a copyright placeholder
        -   A Github repo obeying this setting will be created for you in the next section
    -   `s3_bucket`: The name of an S3 bucket to store assets for this project
        -   This bucket will be created for you in the next section
        -   **Careful**: This needs to not conflict with any existing s3 bucket name and [S3 bucket names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html) must only contain lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens.
        -   This value can be reconfigured in `.envrc`.
    -   `github_account`: The github account that this project will be created in

### Configure

Run `make init` to perform the following steps:

-   `install` - Required by everyone (creator and collaborators) this is itself composed of several sub-steps:

    -   Create a conda environment, `repo_name`, and install the project package in editable mode and its dependencies
    -   Configure and install Git pre-commit hooks

        !!! warning inline end "Requires access to Nesta's AWS account"

    -   Fetch and decrypt the Nesta Metaflow config.
        It should exist in `~/.metaflowconfig/config_ds-cookiecutter.json`

-   Create and configure a github repo `github.com/<github_account>/<repo_name>`
-   Create an S3 bucket `s3_bucket`

If you don't need a github repo or S3 bucket just run `make install`, you can always run `make init` later which will create these resources.

When you change directory to your created project folder, you will see that you are in a git branch `0_setup_cookiecutter`.
Make any tweaks to the cookiecutter required by your project ([see FAQ](../faq/#what-customisations-can-i-make-when-setting-up-the-cookiecutter-without-defeating-the-point-of-having-a-standard-project-template)), commit, and then make a Pull Request to `dev`.

## Collaborating on an existing project

-   Clone the repository and `cd` into the repository.
-   Run `make install` to configure the development environment (see above section)
-   Check the project's `README` for any additional configuration needed (e.g. putting API keys in `.env`)
-   Pull any required inputs into `inputs/` by running `make inputs-pull`
-   Follow the author's documentation, or make them write some if they haven't already!

## How can I use this if I don't have AWS?

If you don't have access to an AWS account you can still use the cookiecutter, you just need to remove a few bits relating to our AWS setup:

-   Remove the `.cookiecutter/state/setup-metaflow` dependency of the `install` recipe within `Makefile` - the Nesta Metaflow config will no longer be fetched and decrypted
-   Remove the `.cookiecutter/state/setup-bucket` dependency of the `init` recipe within `Makefile` - an S3 bucket will no longer be created
-   Remove the `inputs-push` and `inputs-pull` recipes within `Makefile` - an S3 bucket doesn't exist for these commands to push from/pull to.

If you're not using AWS then you do not require `awscli` and `gitcrypt` from the [requirements](#requirements).
