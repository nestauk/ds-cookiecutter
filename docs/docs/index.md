- Increase reliability of data-science @ Nesta
- Make our projects more reproducible
- Allow data-scientists to hand off to data-engineers
- Give data-scientists easy access to cloud computing
- (Light) Data version control
- Increase the value of codebases, and accompanying documentation/reports to stakeholders
- Keep reporting of results in sync with codebase
- Facilitate code-reuse and refactoring into `*_DAPS` and `ds-utils` by reducing coupling and increasing code quality
