# Nesta Data Science Cookiecutter

_A standard project structure for reproducible and collaborative data science projects @ Nesta._

## High-level aims

-   Get going on a new project quickly (but not too quickly!)
-   Nudge users to using a common structure and best-practices to:
    -   Enable data scientists @ Nesta to work with each other
    -   Increase reliability of data science @ Nesta
    -   Make our projects more reproducible
    -   Increase the value of codebases, and accompanying documentation/reports to stakeholders
    -   Make code easier to understand
-   Conceptual/structural overlap with production systems allows data scientists to get code into production faster/easier
-   Teams/projects empowered to build on foundation
